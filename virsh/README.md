# Wrapper scripts for manipulating VMs

In this folder, there are several bash scripts wrapping virsh interface. I frequently utilize these scripts since they are very handy shortcuts to automatically create, clone and destroy KVM based VM instances without graphics and prompts.

For a more integrated scripts to build a whole HPC VM cluster, please refer to my standalone project: [vm-cluster](https://github.com/refraction-ray/vm-cluster).
